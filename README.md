**(a)** Now you will start to arrange the timetable with the mechanism of TTAP. First click the " Set time constraint" button to minimize the possible combination of timetable available.

**(b)** Secondly, click the greenboxes to eliminate the time slots that you do not wish to have classes. 

**(c)** For example, you do not like to have classes after 5.00pm and no classes on Friday, so you click all the slotboxes after 5.00pm and all slotboxes on Friday.

(However, some subjects are only offerd only one available lecture time for selection, so the time constraint is unavoidable eventhough you do not wish to have classes on that time.)
